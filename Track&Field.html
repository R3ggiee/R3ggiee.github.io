            <p>During my junior year of high school, I took a drastic turn away from my longtime commitment to
                basketball and entered the track and field program. At first, I was a sprinter in the 400
                and 200 meters with great. However, my coach was the one who saw more in me and introduced me
                to high jumping, an activity that would quickly become my addiction. I only started
                training for the high jump seriously at the start of the 2019 season, and on my debut, I cleared 5'8" at
                the CCBC-Essex Knights Invitational. From then on, I gave the whole thing everything I had, continually
                rising to a
                height of 5'6", with my lowest point being 5'4" and my maximum point being an incredible 5'10". Then, as
                I was starting to get into my groove, COVID swept in like a bad storm and stopped me cold. But despite
                everything, my enthusiasm for high jumping remained unwavering. I set my sights on Mount St. Mary's
                University since I knew I could continue pursuing my aspirations there and I was determined to reach my
                full potential. As I joined the squad, I was surrounded by nine other high jumpers who were all older
                and more seasoned than me. I accepted the challenge of competing in an atmosphere where
                clearing 6'2" was only the baseline. From a lone jumper in high school to a part of a powerful squad, I
                cherished the opportunity to learn and grow with my teammates. With each practice and competition, I
                pushed myself harder, motivated by the urge to soar higher than ever before. And when I set my sights on
                greater heights, I knew that nothing would stop me from reaching my goals.</p>

            <p>When I went onto the collegiate track for the first time during my freshman year at Mount University, I
                could feel the adrenaline pumping through me. As I threw myself into the high jump competition at the
                Myrtle Beach Collegiate Challenge, the cheers of the audience were thunderous. I felt the excitement of
                competition propelling me forward with each leap, sending me upward. And I knew I was meant to be great
                when I landed in the Northeast Conference Championships with a season-best record of 1.80m (5' 10.75").
                I kept improving as a sophomore, challenging myself to go more and farther every practice. I could feel
                the excitement building as I got ready to compete at the Messiah Invitational. With a fierce sense of
                purpose, I charged the bar and threw myself over it, creating a new personal record and making an
                impression on the competitors. I felt an adrenaline surge as I did so.

            <p>As I stood on the track, the Larry Ellis Invitational was coming to an end, I couldn't help but feel
                bittersweet satisfaction. My career as a high jumper had been nothing short of spectacular, with ups and
                downs, successes and setbacks. And now, as a senior, it was time to say goodbye to the sport that had
                become such an important part of my identity. As I gazed down at the two third-place medals hanging
                proudly around my neck, I remembered that they symbolized a battle won and a task overcome. It had been
                an extraordinary trip from the beginning of my freshman year, when I battled to find my footing, to the
                heights I have now attained. Both the Larry Ellis Invitational and the Alan Connie Shamrock Invitational
                were merely two more events to add to the tapestry of experiences that shaped my time in college. I had
                repeatedly shown my mettle with jumps of 1.93 meters (6' 4") at the Alan Connie Shamrock Invitational
                and 1.95 meters (6' 4.75") at the Larry Ellis Invitational.</p>
